    "overview": "A turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder is now the sole engine available; the car isn't lightning-quick, but its 135 ponies scoot it around town just fine. The last time we tested a 500 with this engine was in 2013 and it delivered a zero-to-60-mph time of 8.1 seconds. A six-speed automatic is optional, but those who prefer to shift for themselves can stay with the standard five-speed manual.\n \nDespite Fiat's claim that the 500's suspension is sport tuned, there's not much athleticism in this chassis. But no one buys a Fiat 500 for the performance—well, maybe those interested in the hot Abarth model do—as the diminutive city car is more of a fashion accessory.",

It's a bit slower than its gas-only sibling, but the EPA also estimates the Corolla Hybrid gets 65% better fuel economy in city driving. In our eyes, the tremendous improvement in efficiency is worth the Hybrid's mild hit to acceleration and slightly higher price tag. \n \n Though it launched in just one modestly equipped trim level in 2020, the Corolla Hybrid lineup has grown over time to include more luxe versions. Last year brought the most significant enhancements; in addition to the appearance and tech upgrades that all 2023 Corollas enjoyed, the Hybrid also added the sporty SE and upscale XLE variants. The expansion continues this year with the Nightshade edition. The Corolla Hybrid Nightshade is primarily an appearance package that adds bronze wheels and black-painted exterior elements — including a blacked-out mesh front grille, mirror caps and lip spoiler — to the SE model. The Corolla Hybrid Nightshade is offered in both front- and all-wheel drive powertrains.",

Nothing else I've driven can go over 250 mph, or had a seven digit price tag. Or had 16 cylinders pouring out 100 horsepower each. A quick two-hour stint behind the wheel reveals the Chiron Super Sport's dual nature, both as an overqualified grand tourer and a comically fast hypercar.",

But let's not forget that the Camaro has, for years, enjoyed both a handling and in some cases a power advantage over the equivalent Mustang.

In short, the 488 GTB has succeeded in surpassing the legendary performance of the 458 while remaining comfortable and easy to drive as almost any normal car. It's more than a little amazing.\n \nFerrari's even upping the ante for 2019 with the new 488 Pista. It comes with a revised engine good for 710 horsepower plus other changes that reduce the car's weight by about 175 pounds. Revised aerodynamics also give the Pista greater downforce at high speed.",

Despite nearing 10 years old, the car still delivers true supercar performance and feels fresh with Lamborghini providing a steady stream of updates and new variants.\n \nThe 2023 Huracan is no exception, adding two wildly different variants to the mix. The Tecnica combines the best parts of the Huracan Evo and last year's addition, the bonkers Huracan STO. While the STO was a track-focused vehicle that borrowed liberally from the Huracan race car, the Tecnica is more street-oriented and tamer in styling — as much as a Lamborghini can ever be tame. The Tecnica is rear-wheel-drive only like the STO and uses the same naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 that makes 631 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque.",

In today's new car market, few cars feel like they are an extension of the driver. If the 911 could talk, it would urge you to drive it harder and faster, and you'd gladly comply thanks to the confidence it instills in you.\n \nThere's a version of the 911 for just about everyone. You have a choice of a coupe, a convertible or a Targa with a power-retractable roof panel. Once you decide on the body style, there's a long list of trims to choose from.

    "overview": "In the frenzy of automakers twisting the SUV into ever more shapes and sizes, the humble four-door sedan continues its slow fade into obscurity. At least among American brands, that is. Today you can count domestic sedans on one hand, and two of them belong to Cadillac. But the 2023 Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing is one high-performance sedan that will not go gently.\n \nThe Blackwing is the ultimate upgrade on the regular CT5. Its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 thumps out 668 horsepower and 659 lb-ft of torque, all sent to the rear wheels via a standard six-speed manual transmission. (A 10-speed automatic is optional.) Output like this might evoke bulky body-builder comparisons, but the Blackwing also handles with deft precision. The standard adaptive suspension keeps it neutral in corners, with well-weighted steering and traction control that allow the driver to have fun.",

    "overview": "We got our first taste of the Type R in the U.S. with the last-generation Civic in 2017 even though prior models were sold overseas since 1997. This latest Type R adopts the current Civic hatchback's styling as a foundation, making it less flashy and garish than the previous generation. Under the hood is the same turbocharged four-cylinder engine, but this time around it makes 315 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. That's a marginal increase of 9 horsepower and 15 lb-ft of torque over the previous Type R.\n \nBut there are subtle improvements, including an updated transmission that has a lighter flywheel and revised gate shift pattern and shift lever for cleaner and snappier shifts. Combine that powertrain with a sport-tuned suspension and Brembo brakes and you've got a pretty serious performance car. The Civic Type R is incredibly fun to drive on a racetrack or your favorite twisty road, yet it's relatively affordable and easy to live with as a daily driver.",

Mercedes will continue to sell the coupe and convertible versions of the C-Class for the 2023 model year, but the two-doors are still based on the fourth-generation C-Class rather than the fifth-generation sedan.\n \nThe new AMG C 43 sedan drops two cylinders, giving it a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder instead of the V6 found in the previous model. It also gets a mild hybrid system like the C 300, but the emphasis here is on performance and not efficiency. Total system output is 402 horsepower and 369 lb-feet of torque, with the starter-generator motor able to kick in a boost of 13 extra horsepower on demand.

The car also adopts the latest in Subaru infotainment, driver assist and collision avoidance technology. However, the safety features are largely restricted to WRX models equipped with the optional continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), which Subaru calls the Performance Transmission.\n \nAfter confirming the high-performance WRX STI won't return to the lineup, the only changes to the 2023 WRX are some new rear headrests and slightly revised settings to the climate control, suspension and all-wheel-drive system. Subaru's high-performance sedan continues to rival other sport compact cars, though it no longer brings the exclusivity of all-wheel drive to the segment.",

And you're passionate. Then you should give the Alfa Romeo Giulia a long, hard look. It's a luxury sedan that trades on its stunning good looks and lust-inducing performance. It makes willing sacrifices to space and practicality in service of beauty and driving pleasure. It's Italian. And it's eschews the comparative stoicism of its Germanic rivals in favor of heart-on-sleeve driving focus.\n \nDespite a mild refresh for 2024 — new headlights and taillights and a new 12.3-inch digital instrument display — the Giulia remains largely the same curvy, quick and involving sport sedan it's been since its 2017 debut. With a 280-horsepower base engine, the Giulia is as rapid as it is pretty. The eight-speed automatic gearbox snaps off upshifts with bolt-action precision, while the meaty steering wheel transmits granular-levels of road information into the driver's hands.",

While most of its competitors have seen recent redesigns, the Q50 is basically the same car that was introduced for 2014. Its exterior design has aged well but everything else is showing its age, especially the interior.\n \nAs much as the Q50 needs a refresh or complete redesign for 2023, it returns with only very minor changes. As such, the Q50's engine remains one of its best attributes. It's a potent turbocharged V6 that provides plenty of power and is quite fuel-efficient. If you prefer rear-wheel drive, the Q50 has you covered, and all-wheel drive is available as an option.",

The starting price of the XF is attractive when compared to expensive European rivals like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series, but not as low as the Lexus ES 350 or Cadillac CT5.

It immediately jumped to the top of our list of favorite vehicles in its class, and to the top of Genesis sales charts. Behind that Bentley-esque grille is a sumptuous interior packed with comfort, tech and safety features that rival any of the established luxury brands. The GV70 doesn't need to be priced lower than its competitors to be appealing, but it is, making it even more attractive.\n \nConfiguring a GV70 is simpler than speccing most of its competitors. Other brands offer lengthy à la carte option menus and assorted packages, but if you're buying a GV70, you pick an engine, a trim level, colors, and that's it. The only additional options are accessories like a cargo net or wheel locks.",

So, instead of replacing the CX-5, the CX-50 complements it for now. Either one can serve your needs well, but Mazda positions the newer CX-50 as a more rugged and capable vehicle.\n \nMazda markets the CX-50 as ready for off-roading, touting its design, driving modes, standard all-wheel drive and list of dealer-installed adventure-oriented accessories as proof. Also, ground clearance ranges between 8.3 and 8.6 inches, which is pretty generous for a typical small crossover, and the Meridian Edition includes standard all-terrain tires for improved grip. Still, you might wonder whether the CX-50 is an off-roader or a soft-roader best used on more gentle trails.",

    "overview": "A turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder is now the sole engine available; the car isn't lightning-quick, but its 135 ponies scoot it around town just fine. The last time we tested a 500 with this engine was in 2013 and it delivered a zero-to-60-mph time of 8.1 seconds. A six-speed automatic is optional, but those who prefer to shift for themselves can stay with the standard five-speed manual.\n \nDespite Fiat's claim that the 500's suspension is sport tuned, there's not much athleticism in this chassis. But no one buys a Fiat 500 for the performance—well, maybe those interested in the hot Abarth model do—as the diminutive city car is more of a fashion accessory.",
